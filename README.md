# C# Exception Handling and Finally Block

This repository demonstrates a common error in C# related to exception handling and the use of the `finally` block.  The `bug.cs` file shows an example of code that throws a `DivideByZeroException`. While the exception is caught, the error handling is incomplete. The `bugSolution.cs` file provides a corrected version with improved exception handling and a properly used `finally` block. 

## Problem

The original code lacks complete exception handling and does not make full use of the `finally` block. This could lead to resource leaks or unexpected program termination.

## Solution

The solution demonstrates how to handle exceptions properly using a `try-catch-finally` block.  The `finally` block is used to ensure cleanup operations are performed regardless of whether an exception occurred.  The improved exception handling provides more informative error messages and prevents unexpected termination of the application.
